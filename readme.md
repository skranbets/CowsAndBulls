Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is an old code-breaking game. 

The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. 
If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:

    Secret number: 4271
    Opponent's try: 1234
    Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number in the least number of guesses wins the game.
